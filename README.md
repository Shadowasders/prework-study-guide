# <Penn Bootcamp Prework Study Guide>

## Description

This starter project was created to help me along with my bootcamp studies. Bootcamps are rigorus institutions and I want to be as ready as possible to hit the ground running throughout this course. I am not the best at studying, but I am quite good at taking notes (I have a 20 page google doc of notes just for the prework alone...), with this app, I can use the installed Javascript to better direct what I focus on in my study time. 

Overall during this process I learned about Javascript, I have previous experience in HTML and CSS, but Javascript has, and does terrify me. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

With this guide, the user can see cherry-picked notes on each of the following disiplines. HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Git (bash & hub). By opening the Chrome DevTools one can see a suggestion of what to study first. A console panel will open either below or to the side of the webpage, where one can see a list of topics learned in the Prework, as well as a suggestion on which topic to study first. The DevTools can be easily accessed by right-clicking on the webpage, selecting inspect, and moving to the console tab.
